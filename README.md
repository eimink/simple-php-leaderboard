# simple-php-leaderboard
Super simple leaderboard system for use in Unity3D games.
Requires PHP and MongoDB. This version uses old, insecure Mongo driver for PHP. Use at your own risk.
You can use this as a template for your own system, however if you are going to use this in a real product, you should probably rewrite most of the input handling and incorporate some sort of hash checking to make sure the data you get is valid.
